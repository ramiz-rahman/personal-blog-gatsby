      <p>
        I love creating delightful web experiences using modern languages and
        frameworks such as JavaScript & React. In my present role, which lives
        in the intersection of business and technology Iâ€™m working with both
        customers and the development team to achieve product-market fit for new
        releases that truly improve the lives of our users.
